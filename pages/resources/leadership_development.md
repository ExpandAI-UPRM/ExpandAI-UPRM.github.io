## Leadership Development Resources


## Leadership development

U.S. CMS will promote leadership development opportunities both within U.S. CMS and the CMS col-
laboration, and in the wider HEP community. The leadership training will also enhance the placement
opportunities in non-academic careers.

- Promoting Diversity in Leadership: Diversity and inclusion will be promoted across all leadership
roles, and at all levels. Suggested implementations:

  1. It is essential to promote a culture, among our junior colleagues, which acknowledges that
project management roles are leadership roles, especially and are relevant for career advance-
ment, in addition to being critical for the operation of the collaboration.

  2. Focus primarily on the positions which directly allocate resources, in addition to those that are
advisory or community-building in nature. This will highlight the efforts for inclusion beyond
diverse representation, and reflect visible respect and value.

- Leadership Planning: Consider leadership planning for long-term sustainability. Suggested implementations:

  1. Effectively use deputy positions to train and mentor future potential leaders/managers, and
increase participation of junior collaboration members to develop the skills necessary to move
into positions of increased responsibility. Increasing the number of deputies may create opportunities
for people to know what leadership looks like before committing.

  2. Evaluate and update the appointment structure for L2 managers and L3 conveners with specific
attention to equity and broadening participation. The full set of skills necessary to serve
effectively in a position should be taken into account.

  3. Consider term limits for leadership positions, consistent with grooming future leaders within
the organization.

- Leadership training. Suggested implementation: collaborators holding leadership positions specific
to U.S. CMS should participate in leadership training such as that offered by international CMS.
DEI concepts should be addressed an even mandated in leadership training (e.g. running meetings,
code of conduct, how to handle violations/issues, etc.).

- Transparency in leadership nominations and appointments. Suggested implementations: all leader-
ship positions within U.S. CMS should be made available for nominations, with clear job mandates
and requirements published for each position; the organizational structure of U.S. CMS should be
publicized within U.S. CMS and kept clearly visible on the collaborationâ€™s webpage. U.S. CMS
may consider using advisory committees to increase transparency and trust in decision-making processes.
In addition, create a database of people who have held leadership roles within the US CMS
collaboration (L2 or L3 conveners and above). This supports institutional memory and the transfer
of knowledge.

- Diversity growth according to a Proportionality Aspiration. In leadership positions controlled by
U.S. CMS, such as upgrades, management can set these methods as a goal for annual improvement
of diversity in leadership at each level so that the leadership increasingly represents the diversity of
the talent pool. In technical or detector-related areas increasing gender diversity in the talent pool
itself should be encouraged however possible. Suggested implementations: annual review of success
in aligning the diversity of a management level to the makeup of the level below; project leadership
can consider workforce diversity when distributing operations and upgrades funds to institutions.
