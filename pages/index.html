<h4>Mission</h4>

{% capture deihead %}
This project is an ExpandAI Partnership between the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez (UPRM) and the AI Institute
for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI) In this project, a minority-serving institution leads
a new collaboration with an AI Institute focused on scaling up already-established research and education programs at UPRM
and to pursue shared, complementary goals around developing AI with use for society in mind and for developing the next
generation of AI education and workforce talent. The collaborative research focuses on the development of AI for
contributing to breakthroughs in high-energy physics experiments. The project will also build community and new centers
of excellence in AI where such activities were not previously well developed.
