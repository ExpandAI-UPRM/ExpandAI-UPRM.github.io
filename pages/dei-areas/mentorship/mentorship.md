## Mentorship Program

The U.S. CMS mentorship program was launched by the Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion committee in 2020 and is now being repeated in 2021. Each year, mentor-mentee pairings
are made based on demographic information (location, career position) as well as the type of mentoring
relationship desired. Both mentees and mentors are asked which types of mentorship they are seeking
or wish to provide, such as career advancement or growth, relocation to or life at CERN, allyship for
minority identity groups, and generally making a new connection within CMS. Mentors and mentees are
purposefully paired outside their own institutions to promote networking and community building.

Resources for mentors and mentees, including discussion topics to foster meaningful communication,
are provided on a website and discussion in a "kick-off" meeting to host the first connection between new

mentors and mentees. Monthly meetings are then encouraged for all partners by email. In 2021, approx-
imately 15% of the partnerships established in 2020 chose to continue working together for another year.

Another 34% of 2020 participants signed up again and will connect with a new partner. The committee
plans to continue this program in the future and include in-person activities at U.S. CMS meetings as
well as mentee- or mentor-specific meet-ups to build community between program participants.
