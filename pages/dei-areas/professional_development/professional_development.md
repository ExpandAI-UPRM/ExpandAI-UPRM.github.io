## Professional development
U.S. CMS plans to provide professional development opportunities appropriate to all levels of experience
and expertise.

- Reduce "alumni" stigma. U.S. CMS should act to reduce the cultural stigma against non-academic
career transitions by providing positive opportunities for trainees to learn about non-academic
careers and communicate their skills using general language. Suggested implementations: connect
members to career development opportunities hosted by Fermilab and CERN, and to industry
partners involved with upgrades, computing, etc; host or promote regular alumni networking events
for U.S. CMS members; improve record-keeping (see more below) to facilitate connections with
alumni.
- Increase awareness of "soft skills". Skills in time management, teamwork, communication, creativity,
self-management, and adaptability are valued both inside and outside CMS. These skills are typically
not directly taught in physics graduate programs, and it can be difficult to evaluate our abilities
and improve. Suggested implementations: regular dialogue on the importance of soft skills in
career advancement; mentorship connections for advice and help in a low-risk environment; training
opportunities related to different career levels.
